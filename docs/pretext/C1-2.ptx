          A psychologist wants to know the probability that exposure to a certain simuli increases anxiety.  He wants to find a <m> 95</m>% confidence interval with margin of error <m>ME=0.02</m>.
      </p>
      <p>
          A previous study showed that  of <m>46\ </m> test subjects,  <m>20\ </m>had increased anxiety after exposure to the stimuli.  How many subjects should now be tested to obtain a <m>95</m>% confidence interval with margin of error <m>ME=0.02</m>?
      </p>
      
      <!--<ol>
          <li>
              Find a <m>95</m>% confidence interval for the proportion of  that .
          </li>
          <li>
              Using complete sentences, explain what the confidence interval means in the context of this problem.

      <title>Partial Solution:</title>
      <ul>
          <li>
              The sample proportion of the initial study is <m>\hat{p}=0.43478260869565216</m>.
          </li>
          <li>
              For a 95% confidence interval,  <m>z^*=1.9599639845400536</m>.
          </li>
          <li>
              The margin of error is <m>ME=0.02</m>.
          </li>
          <li>
              The number of subjects should now be tested is at least <m>2361</m>.
