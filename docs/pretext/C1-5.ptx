  <statement>
      <p>
          A sociologist wants to know what proportion of a town's residents feel like they trust their neighbors.  They want to find a <m> 95</m>% confidence interval with margin of error <m>ME=0.02</m>.
      </p>
      <p>
          A previous study showed that  of <m>74\ </m> surveyed residents ,  <m>28\ </m>trusted their neighbors.  How many residents should the sociologist survey now to obtain a <m>95</m>% confidence interval with margin of error <m>ME=0.02</m>?
      </p>
      
      <!--<ol>
          <li>
              Find a <m>95</m>% confidence interval for the proportion of  that .

      <title>Partial Solution:</title>
      <ul>
          <li>
              The sample proportion of the initial study is <m>\hat{p}=0.3783783783783784</m>.
          </li>
          <li>
              For a 95% confidence interval,  <m>z^*=1.9599639845400536</m>.
          </li>
          <li>
              The margin of error is <m>ME=0.02</m>.
          </li>
          <li>
              The number of residents should the sociologist survey now is at least <m>2259</m>.
