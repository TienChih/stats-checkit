  <statement>
     <p>
         A non-profit printing t-shirts for their volunteers have historically needed sizes  <m>27</m>%  small, <m>20</m>%  medium, <m>33</m>%  large, and <m>20</m>%  x-large.
      </p>
      <p>
          In a sampling of size requests at a new location,   <m>6.0</m>  volunteers requested a small, <m>17.0</m>  volunteers requested a medium, <m>26.0</m>  volunteers requested a large, and <m>12.0</m>  volunteers requested a x-large.
      </p>
      <p>
          Use a <m>\chi^2</m> goodness of fit test to test whether or not the distribution of t-shirt sizes needed match that of previous locations.

      <ul>
          <li>
              State the null hypothesis for this test.

              State the alternative hypothesis for this test.
