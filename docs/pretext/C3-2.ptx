  <statement>
     <p>
         The distribution of moth species in a local forest has historically been  <m>26</m>%  species 1, <m>21</m>%  species 2, <m>29</m>%  species 3, and <m>24</m>%  species 4.
      </p>
      <p>
          A year after an industrial accident, a sample of moths collected from this forest consisted of  <m>16.0</m>  moths of species 1, <m>8.0</m>  moths of species 2, <m>29.0</m>  moths of species 3, and <m>13.0</m>  moths of species 4.
      </p>
      <p>
          Use a <m>\chi^2</m> goodness of fit test to test whether or not the distributions of moths remain unchanged.
      </p>
      <ul>
          <li>
              State the null hypothesis for this test.
          </li>
          <li>
              State the alternative hypothesis for this test.
          </li>
          <li>
              Using complete sentences, state the meaning of the <m>p</m>-value in the context of this problem.

     <ul>
          <li>
              The null hypothesis is <m>H_0:</m> The distribution of moths remains unchanged after the accident.
          </li>
         <li>
              The alternative hypothesis is <m>H_A:</m> The distribution of months has changed after the accident.
          </li>
          <li>
              There are <m>3</m> degrees of freedom.

         <li>
              The <m>\chi^2</m> value is <m>8.1446053946054</m>.
