  <statement>
     <p>
         In a casino, there is a game of chance where a wheel is spun, and the chances of it landing on different colors are  <m>31</m>%  blue, <m>16</m>%  green, <m>28</m>%  orange, and <m>25</m>%  red.
      </p>
      <p>
          In a sampling of spins one night, the colors that came up were   <m>45</m>  spins came up blue, <m>24</m>  spins came up green, <m>27</m>  spins came up orange, and <m>21</m>  spins came up red.
      </p>
      <p>
          Use a <m>\chi^2</m> goodness of fit test to test whether or not the distributions of colors on this wheel match that of the game.
      </p>

          <li>
              State the null hypothesis for this test.
          </li>

     <ul>
          <li>
              The null hypothesis is <m>H_0:</m> The distribution of colors matches that of the game.
          </li>
         <li>
              The alternative hypothesis is <m>H_A:</m> The distribution of colors do not match that of the game.
