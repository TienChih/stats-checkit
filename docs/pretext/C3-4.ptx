  <statement>
     <p>
         In previous locations, a restaurants the main protein for dinner entrees ordered by customers have been  <m>27</m>%  beef, <m>21</m>%  chicken, <m>24</m>%  pork, and <m>28</m>%  vegan.
      </p>
      <p>
          In a random sampling of dinner entrees ordered at their new location, the main proteins were  <m>24.0</m>  main proteins that were beef, <m>6.0</m>  main proteins that were chicken, <m>27.0</m>  main proteins that were pork, and <m>22.0</m>  main proteins that were vegan.
      </p>
      <p>
          Use a <m>\chi^2</m> goodness of fit test to test whether or not the distributions or ordered main proteins was the same at the new location as previous locations.

              The null hypothesis is <m>H_0:</m> The distribution of main proteins is the same as previous locations.
          </li>
         <li>
              The alternative hypothesis is <m>H_A:</m> The distribution of main proteins is different from previous locations.
