  <statement>
     <p>
         A non-profit printing t-shirts for their volunteers have historically needed sizes  <m>20</m>%  small, <m>24</m>%  medium, <m>28</m>%  large, and <m>28</m>%  x-large.
      </p>
      <p>
          In a sampling of size requests at a new location,   <m>18</m>  volunteers requested a small, <m>29</m>  volunteers requested a medium, <m>21</m>  volunteers requested a large, and <m>41</m>  volunteers requested a x-large.
      </p>
      <p>
          Use a <m>\chi^2</m> goodness of fit test to test whether or not the distribution of t-shirt sizes needed match that of previous locations.

      <ul>
          <li>
              State the null hypothesis for this test.

     <ul>
          <li>
              The null hypothesis is <m>H_0:</m> The distribution of t-shirt sizes matches that of previous locations.

         <li>
              The alternative hypothesis is <m>H_A:</m> The distribution of t-shirt sizes do not match that of previous locations.

          <li>
              There are <m>3</m> degrees of freedom.
