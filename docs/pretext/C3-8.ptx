  <statement>
     <p>
         The distribution of majors at a University are  <m>19</m>%  Business majors, <m>22</m>%  Humanities majors, <m>34</m>%  Social Science majors, and <m>25</m>%  STEM majors.
      </p>
      <p>
          Professor Martinez's introductory lecture class consists of  <m>22</m>  students who are Business majors, <m>34</m>  students who are Humanities majors, <m>70</m>  students who are Social Science majors, and <m>58</m>  students who are STEM majors.
      </p>
      <p>
          Use a <m>\chi^2</m> goodness of fit test to test whether or not the distributions majors in Dr. Martinez's class is representative of the student body at the University.
