      <p>
          <me>
              \begin{array}[|c|c|c|c|]
              \hline
              &amp; \text{ Happiness } &amp; \text{ Anger } &amp; \text{ Sadness }\\
              \hline
              \text{ Video 1 } &amp; 59 &amp; 82 &amp; 47\\
              \hline
              \text{ Video 2 } &amp; 43 &amp; 79 &amp; 21\\
              \hline
              \end{array}
          </me>
          
      </p>
      
      
     
      <p>
          Use a <m>\chi^2</m> independence test to test  whether emotional reactions are independent of the choice of video.
      </p>
      <ul>
          <li>
              State the null hypothesis for this test.
          </li>
          <li>
              State the alternative hypothesis for this test.
          </li>
          <li>
              Using complete sentences, state the meaning of the <m>p</m>-value in the context of this problem.
          </li>
          <li>
              What do we conclude?  Why?
          </li>
      </ul>

     <ul>
          <li>
              The null hypothesis is <m>H_0:\ </m>Emotional reactions are independent of the choice of video.
          </li>
         <li>
              The alternative hypothesis is <m>H_A:\ </m>Emotional reactions are not independent of the choice of video.
          </li>
          <li>
              There are <m>2</m> degrees of freedom.
          </li>
         <li>
              The <m>\chi^2</m> value is <m>6.50936793906607</m>.
          </li>
         <li>
              The <m>p</m>-value is <m>0.03859301530498194</m>.
