      <p>
          Use a <m>\chi^2</m> independence test to test  whether position on this law is independent of party affiliation.
      </p>
      <ul>
          <li>
              State the null hypothesis for this test.
          </li>
          <li>
              State the alternative hypothesis for this test.
          </li>
          <li>
              Using complete sentences, state the meaning of the <m>p</m>-value in the context of this problem.
