          <ol>
              <li>
                  Find the probability that a randomly selected athlete's retirement age is   is at least  <m>30.15 </m>  years.

              <li>
                  Find the probability that a randomly selected athlete's retirement age is  between <m>30.33 </m> and <m>39.65</m>  years.
