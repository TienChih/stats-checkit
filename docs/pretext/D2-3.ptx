          <ol>
              <li>
                  Find the probability that a randomly selected athlete's retirement age is   is at most  <m>37.32 </m>  years.

              <li>
                  Find the probability that a randomly selected athlete's retirement age is  between <m>21.33 </m> and <m>37.33</m>  years.
