      <p>
          Suppose the probability that a person clicks on a malicious link in a scam email is  <m>0.07</m>. A scammer sends scam emails to  <m>9900</m>  people.  Let <m>X</m> denote the  number of people who click the link.  Find the following:
          
      </p>
      
      
      
      
      <p>
          <ol>
              <li>
                  <m>E(X)</m>, the expected  number of people who click the link.
              </li>
              
              <li>
                  <p>
                      <m>\sigma_A</m>, the standard deviation of the  number of people who click the link.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                      Then use the normal approximation of <m>X</m> to find the following:

              </li>
             
              <li>
                  Find the probability that the number of number of people who click the email is  between <m>640 </m> and <m>682</m>  people.
              </li>
              
              
              <li>
                  Find <m>X^*</m> such that the probability that  number of people who click the link  is at most  <m>X^*</m>  people is <m>0.41</m>.
