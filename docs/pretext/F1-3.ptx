          <ol>
              <li>To estimate the average lifespan of a rat, 120 rats are born into captivity have their lifespans tracked.</li>
              <li>To estimate the proportion of mice which may develop tumors, 90 captive rats are examined to see if they develop tumors over their lifetime.</li>
              <li>To estimate the proportion of children who are homeschooled, 200 children are randomly selected and their schooling information is checked.</li>
              <li>To estimate the average weight of an adult female african elephant, 200 adult female african elephants are caught and weighed.</li>
