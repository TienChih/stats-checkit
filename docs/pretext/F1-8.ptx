              <li>To estimate the proportion of 4th graders who like math, 150 4th graders are polled about their affinity for math.</li>
              <li>To estimate the average running speed of a breed of dog, 30 dogs are randomly selected and their top speeds measured.</li>
              <li>To estimate the proportion of wolf cubs who will survive to adulthood, 40 wolf cubs are tracked from birth.</li>
              <li>To estimate the average lifespan of a rat, 120 rats are born into captivity have their lifespans tracked.</li>
