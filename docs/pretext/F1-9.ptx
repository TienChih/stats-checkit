          For each of the following, identify the <em>parameter of interest</em>, and the <em>point estimate</em>.
          <ol>
              <li>To estimate the average running speed of a breed of dog, 30 dogs are randomly selected and their top speeds measured.</li>
              <li>To estimate the average caloric value of fast food items, 50 fast food items are chosen randomly and their avverage caloric value is computed.</li>
              <li>To estimate the proportion of wolf cubs who will survive to adulthood, 40 wolf cubs are tracked from birth.</li>
              <li>To estimate the average lifespan of a rat, 120 rats are born into captivity have their lifespans tracked.</li>
