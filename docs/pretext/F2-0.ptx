  <statement>
      <p>
          A mayor wants to measure public support for their new proposal.  Their team conducts a survey of constituents.
      </p>
      <p>
Suppose that for   <m>n=95</m> surveyed constituents, <m>60</m> approve the proposal. 
      </p>
      
      <ol>
          <li>
              Find a <m>95</m>% confidence interval for the proportion of all constituents that approve the proposal.
          </li>
          <li>
              Using complete sentences, explain what the confidence interval means in the context of this problem.
          </li>
          <li>
              Suppose the mayor claims that at most <m>22</m>% of all constituents  approve the proposal.  Does the confidence interval you found support this claim?  Explain why or why not.
          </li>
          
      </ol>
          
          
          
          
      
  </statement>
  <answer>
      <ul>
          <li>
              The sample proportion is <m>\hat{p}=\frac{12}{19}</m>.
          </li>
          <li>
              The standard error is <m>SE=0.0494907732612239</m>.
          </li>
          <li>
              For a 95% confidence interval,  <m>z^*=1.9599639845400536</m>.
          </li>
          <li>
              The proportion of all constituents that approve the proposal has a 95% chance of of falling in <m>[0.534578814209384, 0.728579080527458]</m>.
          </li>
          <li>
              The confidence interval does not support the claim.
          </li>
      </ul>
