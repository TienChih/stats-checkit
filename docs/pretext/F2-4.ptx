  <statement>
      <p>
          A county health department wants to know what proportion of their citizens are willing to take a vaccine for a novel virus.  They survey a random selection residents in the county.
      </p>
      <p>
Suppose that for   <m>n=67</m> surveyed residents, <m>22</m> had or were willing to be vaccinated. 
      </p>
      
      <ol>
          <li>
              Find a <m>95</m>% confidence interval for the proportion of all residents in the county that had or would be willing to be vaccinated.
          </li>
          <li>
              Using complete sentences, explain what the confidence interval means in the context of this problem.
          </li>
          <li>
              Suppose the health department claims that at least <m>46</m>% of all residents in the county  had or would be willing to be vaccinated.  Does the confidence interval you found support this claim?  Explain why or why not.
          </li>
          
      </ol>
          
          
          
          
      
  </statement>
  <answer>
      <ul>
          <li>
              The sample proportion is <m>\hat{p}=\frac{22}{67}</m>.
          </li>
          <li>
              The standard error is <m>SE=0.0573727138284734</m>.
          </li>
          <li>
              For a 95% confidence interval,  <m>z^*=1.9599639845400536</m>.
          </li>
          <li>
              The proportion of all residents in the county that had or would be willing to be vaccinated has a 95% chance of of falling in <m>[0.215909756156093, 0.440806661754355]</m>.
          </li>
          <li>
              The confidence interval does not support the claim.
          </li>
      </ul>
