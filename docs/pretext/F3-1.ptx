  <statement>
      <p>
          An engineer tests to see if the he proproportion of iron samples, when sprayed with a new compound, would rust when exposed to water is greater than <m>  57</m>%.  He conducts an experiment.
      </p>
      <p>
Suppose that for   <m>n=103</m> iron samples, <m>69</m> rusted. Test the hypothesis that  the proportion of iron samples that would rust is greater than <m>  57</m>%. 
      </p>
      
      <ol>
          <li>
              State the null hypothesis.

     <ul>
          <li>
              The null hypothesis is <m>H_0: p=0.57</m>.

          <li>
              The sampling distribution has mean <m>0.57</m> and standard error <m>SE=0.0487812633137503</m>.

         <li>
              The sample proportion is <m>\hat{p}=0.6699029126213593</m> which has <m>z</m>-score <m>z=2.04797715013664</m>.
