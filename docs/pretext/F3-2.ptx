  <statement>
      <p>
          An political campaign wants to know if the proportion of voters who support their candidiate is less than <m>  36</m>%.  They conduct a survey of potential voters.
      </p>
      <p>
Suppose that for   <m>n=299</m> surveyed potential voters, <m>95</m> supported the candidiate. Test the hypothesis that  the proportion of all potential voters that support their candidiate is less than <m>  36</m>%. 
      </p>
      
      <ol>
          <li>
              State the null hypothesis.
          </li>
          <li>
              State the alternative hypothesis.
          </li>
          <li>
              What is the <m>p</m>-value?
          </li>
          <li>
              Using complete sentences, state the meaning of the <m>p</m>-value in the context of this problem.
          </li>
          <li>
              What do we conclude?  Why?

     <ul>
          <li>
              The null hypothesis is <m>H_0: p=0.36</m>.

          <li>
              The sampling distribution has mean <m>0.36</m> and standard error <m>SE=0.0277591167343795</m>.

         <li>
              The sample proportion is <m>\hat{p}=0.3177257525083612</m> which has <m>z</m>-score <m>z=-1.52289598751110</m>.
