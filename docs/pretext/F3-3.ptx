  <statement>
      <p>
          An engineer tests to see if the he proproportion of iron samples, when sprayed with a new compound, would rust when exposed to water is greater than <m>  70</m>%.  He conducts an experiment.
      </p>
      <p>
Suppose that for   <m>n=273</m> iron samples, <m>201</m> rusted. Test the hypothesis that  the proportion of iron samples that would rust is greater than <m>  70</m>%. 
      </p>
      
      <ol>
          <li>
              State the null hypothesis.

          <li>
              State the alternative hypothesis.

     <ul>
          <li>
              The null hypothesis is <m>H_0: p=0.70</m>.

         <li>
              The alternative hypothesis is <m>H_A: p\gneq0.70</m>.
          </li>
          <li>
              The sampling distribution has mean <m>0.70</m> and standard error <m>SE=0.0277350098112615</m>.
