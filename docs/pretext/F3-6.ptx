  <statement>
      <p>
          An engineer tests to see if the he proproportion of iron samples, when sprayed with a new compound, would rust when exposed to water is greater than <m>  48</m>%.  He conducts an experiment.
      </p>
      <p>
Suppose that for   <m>n=244</m> iron samples, <m>129</m> rusted. Test the hypothesis that  the proportion of iron samples that would rust is greater than <m>  48</m>%. 
      </p>
      
      <ol>
          <li>
              State the null hypothesis.

          <li>
              State the alternative hypothesis.

     <ul>
          <li>
              The null hypothesis is <m>H_0: p=0.48</m>.

         <li>
              The alternative hypothesis is <m>H_A: p\gneq0.48</m>.
          </li>
          <li>
              The sampling distribution has mean <m>0.48</m> and standard error <m>SE=0.0319836023560845</m>.

         <li>
              The sample proportion is <m>\hat{p}=0.5286885245901639</m> which has <m>z</m>-score <m>z=1.52229645829440</m>.

              The <m>p</m>-value is <m>0.06396740755627994</m>.
