  <statement>
      <p>
          A marine biologist wonders if the proportion of turtles in a coral reef that were infected with a new parasite is less than <m>  68</m>%.  She gathers a sample of turtles.
      </p>
      <p>
Suppose that for   <m>n=325</m> turtles found in the coral reef, <m>203</m> were infected. Test the hypothesis that  the proportion of turtles that are infected is less than <m>  68</m>%. 
      </p>
      
      <ol>
          <li>
              State the null hypothesis.
          </li>
          <li>
              State the alternative hypothesis.
          </li>
          <li>
              What is the <m>p</m>-value?
          </li>
          <li>
              Using complete sentences, state the meaning of the <m>p</m>-value in the context of this problem.
          </li>
          <li>
              What do we conclude?  Why?

     <ul>
          <li>
              The null hypothesis is <m>H_0: p=0.68</m>.

         <li>
              The alternative hypothesis is <m>H_A: p\lneq0.68</m>.
          </li>
          <li>
              The sampling distribution has mean <m>0.68</m> and standard error <m>SE=0.0258754412820045</m>.

         <li>
              The sample proportion is <m>\hat{p}=0.6246153846153846</m> which has <m>z</m>-score <m>z=-2.14043172369523</m>.

              The <m>p</m>-value is <m>0.016159946530304184</m>.
