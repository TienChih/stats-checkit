      <p>
          A financial consultant examines the rates of return of stocks in a portfolio.  He takes a random samples of stocks and analyzes them.  Out of  <m>46</m>  analyzed stocks, the average % rate of return  <m>\bar{x}=9.384</m>  % return, with sample standard deviation <m>s=48.13</m>  % return.
      </p>
      
      <ul>
          <li>  Test the hypothesis that  the average % rate of return for the portfolio  is greater than <m>  5</m>  % return.
              <ol>
          <li>
              State the null hypothesis.
          </li>
          <li>
              State the alternative hypothesis.
          </li>
          <li>
              What is the <m>p</m>-value?
          </li>
          <li>
              Using complete sentences, state the meaning of the <m>p</m>-value in the context of this problem.
          </li>
          <li>
              What do we conclude?  Why?
          </li>
          
      </ol>
          </li>
          <li>
              Find a <m>95</m>% confidence interval for the  the average % rate of return for the portfolio.  Using complete sentences, explain what the confidence interval means in the context of this problem.

              For a <m>95</m>% confidence interval,  <m>t^*=2.014103388880847</m>.
          </li>
          <li>
              The  the average % rate of return for the portfolio  has a <m>95</m>% chance of of falling in <m>[-4.90884572529250, 23.6768457252925]</m>.
