      <p>
          An engineer examples the Brinell hardness of an experimental allow.  She measures the hardness of a random collection of alloy samples.  Out of  <m>33</m>  measured alloy samples, the average sample hardness was  <m>\bar{x}=171.024</m>  Brinell hardness, with sample standard deviation <m>s=11.951</m>  Brinell hardness.
      </p>
      
      <ul>
          <li>  Test the hypothesis that  the average hardness of the alloy  is greater than <m>  170</m>  Brinell hardness.
              <ol>
          <li>
              State the null hypothesis.
          </li>
          <li>
              State the alternative hypothesis.
          </li>
          <li>
              What is the <m>p</m>-value?
          </li>
          <li>
              Using complete sentences, state the meaning of the <m>p</m>-value in the context of this problem.
          </li>
          <li>
              What do we conclude?  Why?
          </li>
          
      </ol>
          </li>
          <li>
              Find a <m>99</m>% confidence interval for the  the average hardness of the alloy.  Using complete sentences, explain what the confidence interval means in the context of this problem.

      <title>Partial Solution:</title>
      
     <ul>
          <li>
              The null hypothesis is <m>H_0: \mu=170</m>.
          </li>
         <li>
              The alternative hypothesis is <m>H_A: \mu\gneq170</m>.
          </li>
          <li>
              The sampling distribution has mean <m>170</m> and standard error <m>SE=2.08040206632655</m>.
          </li>
         <li>
              The sample mean is <m>\bar{x}=171.024</m> which has <m>t</m>-score <m>t=0.49221254707178863</m>.
          </li>
         <li>
              The <m>p</m>-value is <m>0.3129645795425554</m>.
          </li>
         
         <li>
              For a <m>99</m>% confidence interval,  <m>t^*=2.7384814820121828</m>.
          </li>
          <li>
              The  the average hardness of the alloy  has a <m>99</m>% chance of of falling in <m>[165.326857466225, 176.721142533775]</m>.
