      <p>
          A wildlife biologist wants to study wild turkeys from two different forests.  Out of  <m>23</m>  captured turkeys from Forest A, the average weight was  <m>\bar{x}_1=24.917</m>  pounds, with sample standard deviation <m>s_1=4.538</m>  pounds.  Then out of <m>23</m>  captured turkeys from Forest B, the average weight was  <m>\bar{x}_2=23.506</m>  pounds, with sample standard deviation <m>s_2=3.101</m>  pounds.
      </p>
      
      <ul>
          <li>  Test the hypothesis that  the difference in average weight of turkeys between Forest A and Forest B, <m>\mu_1-\mu_2</m>, is less than <m>  -0.3</m>  pounds.
              <ol>
          <li>
              State the null hypothesis.
          </li>
          <li>
              State the alternative hypothesis.
          </li>
          <li>
              What is the <m>p</m>-value?
          </li>
          <li>
              Using complete sentences, state the meaning of the <m>p</m>-value in the context of this problem.
          </li>
          <li>
              What do we conclude?  Why?
          </li>
          
      </ol>
          </li>
          <li>
              Find a <m>95</m>% confidence interval for the  the difference in average weight of turkeys between Forest A and Forest B.  Using complete sentences, explain what the confidence interval means in the context of this problem.

      <title>Partial Solution:</title>
      
     <ul>
          <li>
              The null hypothesis is <m>H_0: \mu_1-\mu_2=-0.3</m>.
          </li>
         <li>
              The alternative hypothesis is <m>H_A: \mu_1-\mu_2\lneq-0.3</m>.
          </li>
          <li>
              The sampling distribution has mean <m>-0.3</m> and standard error <m>SE=1.14606405845701</m>.
          </li>
         <li>
              The sample mean is <m>\bar{x}=</m> which has <m>t</m>-score <m>t=-0.9694048005447272</m>.
          </li>
         <li>
              The <m>p</m>-value is <m>0.171440470080654</m>.
          </li>
         
         <li>
              For a <m>95</m>% confidence interval,  <m>t^*=2.0738730679040245</m>.
          </li>
          <li>
              The  the difference in average weight of turkeys between Forest A and Forest B  has a <m>95</m>% chance of of falling in <m>[-3.78779138492678, 0.965791384926780]</m>.
          </li>
