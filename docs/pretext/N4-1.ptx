      <p>
          A sociologist compares number of daily police stops in two different neighborhoods of the same city with similar size.  Out of  <m>46</m>  observed days, the daily number of stops for Neighborhood A was  <m>\bar{x}_1=65.458</m>  stops, with sample standard deviation <m>s_1=12.709</m>  stops.  Then out of <m>46</m>  observed days, the daily number of stops for Neighborhood A was  <m>\bar{x}_2=66.248</m>  stops, with sample standard deviation <m>s_2=7.831</m>  stops.
      </p>
      
      <ul>
          <li>  Test the hypothesis that  the difference in average daily police stops between  Neighborhood A and Neighborhood B, <m>\mu_1-\mu_2</m>, is greater than <m>  0</m>  stops.
              <ol>
          <li>
              State the null hypothesis.
          </li>
          <li>
              State the alternative hypothesis.
          </li>
          <li>
              What is the <m>p</m>-value?
          </li>
          <li>
              Using complete sentences, state the meaning of the <m>p</m>-value in the context of this problem.
          </li>
          <li>
              What do we conclude?  Why?
          </li>
          
      </ol>
          </li>
          <li>
              Find a <m>99</m>% confidence interval for the  the difference in average daily police stops between  Neighborhood A and Neighborhood B.  Using complete sentences, explain what the confidence interval means in the context of this problem.

     <ul>
          <li>
              The null hypothesis is <m>H_0: \mu_1-\mu_2=0</m>.
          </li>
         <li>
              The alternative hypothesis is <m>H_A: \mu_1-\mu_2\gneq0</m>.
          </li>
          <li>
              The sampling distribution has mean <m>0</m> and standard error <m>SE=2.20100393101599</m>.
          </li>
         <li>
              The sample mean is <m>\bar{x}=</m> which has <m>t</m>-score <m>t=0.35892711906031666</m>.
          </li>
         <li>
              The <m>p</m>-value is <m>0.3606641259391452</m>.
          </li>
         
         <li>
              For a <m>99</m>% confidence interval,  <m>t^*=2.689585019374643</m>.
          </li>
          <li>
              The  the difference in average daily police stops between  Neighborhood A and Neighborhood B  has a <m>99</m>% chance of of falling in <m>[-5.12978720044530, 6.70978720044530]</m>.
