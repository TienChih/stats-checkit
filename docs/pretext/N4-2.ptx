      <p>
          A manufacturer wants to compare the number of defects to types of machines produce.  For a month, machines of both type were observed.  Out of  <m>42</m>  Model A machines, the average number of defects was  <m>\bar{x}_1=1.16</m>  defects, with sample standard deviation <m>s_1=0.315</m>  defects.  Then out of <m>42</m>  Model B machines, the average number of defects was  <m>\bar{x}_2=1.226</m>  defects, with sample standard deviation <m>s_2=0.633</m>  defects.
      </p>
      
      <ul>
          <li>  Test the hypothesis that  the difference in average number of defects between Model A and Model B, <m>\mu_1-\mu_2</m>, is greater than <m>  0</m>  defects.
              <ol>
          <li>
              State the null hypothesis.
          </li>
          <li>
              State the alternative hypothesis.
          </li>
          <li>
              What is the <m>p</m>-value?
          </li>
          <li>
              Using complete sentences, state the meaning of the <m>p</m>-value in the context of this problem.
          </li>
          <li>
              What do we conclude?  Why?
          </li>
          
      </ol>
          </li>
          <li>
              Find a <m>95</m>% confidence interval for the  the difference in average number of defects between Model A and Model B.  Using complete sentences, explain what the confidence interval means in the context of this problem.

     <ul>
          <li>
              The null hypothesis is <m>H_0: \mu_1-\mu_2=0</m>.
          </li>
         <li>
              The alternative hypothesis is <m>H_A: \mu_1-\mu_2\gneq0</m>.
          </li>
          <li>
              The sampling distribution has mean <m>0</m> and standard error <m>SE=0.109099561345196</m>.
          </li>
         <li>
              The sample mean is <m>\bar{x}=</m> which has <m>t</m>-score <m>t=0.6049520198451825</m>.
          </li>
         <li>
              The <m>p</m>-value is <m>0.27427233973524734</m>.
          </li>
         
         <li>
              For a <m>95</m>% confidence interval,  <m>t^*=2.0195409704413754</m>.
          </li>
          <li>
              The  the difference in average number of defects between Model A and Model B  has a <m>95</m>% chance of of falling in <m>[-0.154331033993806, 0.286331033993806]</m>.
