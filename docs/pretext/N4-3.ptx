      <p>
          A retail chain advertises two different locations using different marketing campaigns, to compare the results.  Out of  <m>33</m>  observed days, the daily revenue for Store A was  <m>\bar{x}_1=988.333</m>  dollars, with sample standard deviation <m>s_1=144.659</m>  dollars.  Then out of <m>33</m>  observed days, the daily revenue for Store B was  <m>\bar{x}_2=1093.07</m>  dollars, with sample standard deviation <m>s_2=55.944</m>  dollars.
      </p>
      
      <ul>
          <li>  Test the hypothesis that  the difference in average daily retail between  Store A and Store B, <m>\mu_1-\mu_2</m>, is greater than <m>  75</m>  dollars.
              <ol>
          <li>
              State the null hypothesis.
          </li>
          <li>
              State the alternative hypothesis.
          </li>
          <li>
              What is the <m>p</m>-value?
          </li>
          <li>
              Using complete sentences, state the meaning of the <m>p</m>-value in the context of this problem.
          </li>
          <li>
              What do we conclude?  Why?
          </li>
          
      </ol>
          </li>
          <li>
              Find a <m>99</m>% confidence interval for the  the difference in average daily retail between  Store A and Store B.  Using complete sentences, explain what the confidence interval means in the context of this problem.

      <title>Partial Solution:</title>
      
     <ul>
          <li>
              The null hypothesis is <m>H_0: \mu_1-\mu_2=75</m>.
          </li>
         <li>
              The alternative hypothesis is <m>H_A: \mu_1-\mu_2\gneq75</m>.
          </li>
          <li>
              The sampling distribution has mean <m>75</m> and standard error <m>SE=26.9994149302491</m>.
          </li>
         <li>
              The sample mean is <m>\bar{x}=</m> which has <m>t</m>-score <m>t=1.101394236757472</m>.
          </li>
         <li>
              The <m>p</m>-value is <m>0.13947042292176937</m>.
          </li>
         
         <li>
              For a <m>99</m>% confidence interval,  <m>t^*=2.7384814820121828</m>.
          </li>
          <li>
              The  the difference in average daily retail between  Store A and Store B  has a <m>99</m>% chance of of falling in <m>[30.7996021883496, 178.674397811650]</m>.
