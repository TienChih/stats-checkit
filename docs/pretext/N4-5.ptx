      <p>
          A retail chain advertises two different locations using different marketing campaigns, to compare the results.  Out of  <m>20</m>  observed days, the daily revenue for Store A was  <m>\bar{x}_1=884.306</m>  dollars, with sample standard deviation <m>s_1=111.837</m>  dollars.  Then out of <m>20</m>  observed days, the daily revenue for Store B was  <m>\bar{x}_2=866.417</m>  dollars, with sample standard deviation <m>s_2=71.871</m>  dollars.
      </p>
      
      <ul>
          <li>  Test the hypothesis that  the difference in average daily retail between  Store A and Store B, <m>\mu_1-\mu_2</m>, is less than <m>  0</m>  dollars.
              <ol>
          <li>
              State the null hypothesis.
          </li>
          <li>
              State the alternative hypothesis.
          </li>
          <li>
              What is the <m>p</m>-value?
          </li>
          <li>
              Using complete sentences, state the meaning of the <m>p</m>-value in the context of this problem.
          </li>
          <li>
              What do we conclude?  Why?
          </li>
          
      </ol>
          </li>
          <li>
              Find a <m>95</m>% confidence interval for the  the difference in average daily retail between  Store A and Store B.  Using complete sentences, explain what the confidence interval means in the context of this problem.

     <ul>
          <li>
              The null hypothesis is <m>H_0: \mu_1-\mu_2=0</m>.
          </li>
         <li>
              The alternative hypothesis is <m>H_A: \mu_1-\mu_2\lneq0</m>.
          </li>
          <li>
              The sampling distribution has mean <m>0</m> and standard error <m>SE=29.7262133562282</m>.
          </li>
         <li>
              The sample mean is <m>\bar{x}=</m> which has <m>t</m>-score <m>t=-0.6017920878661768</m>.

         <li>
              The <m>p</m>-value is <m>0.2772131589420995</m>.
          </li>
         
         <li>
              For a <m>95</m>% confidence interval,  <m>t^*=2.0930240544083096</m>.
          </li>
          <li>
              The  the difference in average daily retail between  Store A and Store B  has a <m>95</m>% chance of of falling in <m>[-80.1066796010592, 44.3286796010592]</m>.
