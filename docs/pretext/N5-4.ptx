      <p>
          A farmer testing fertilizers wants to compare the average yield of tomato plants when using two different fertilizers.  They want to be able to detect a difference of  <m> -0.17</m>  pounds. Suppose they are aware the yield of tomato plants using either fertilizer has standard deviation  <m> 0.58</m>  pounds.
      </p>
      
      <ol>
          <li>
              What is the power of a test if the number of observed tomato plants for both fertilizers was  <m>n=39</m>?
          </li>
          <li>
              Explain what this power means in the context of this problem.
          </li>
          <li>
              How many tomato plants using each type of fertilizer would have to observe to detect this difference with power:  <m>60</m>%?
          </li>
      </ol>

  <answer>
      <title>Partial Solution:</title>
      
     <ul>
          <li>
              The standard error if <m>n=39</m> would be <m>SE=0.131344135960773</m>.  The cutoff for a statistically significant test is a difference of <m>-0.2574297760636474</m>  pounds.  The power of the test is <m>P(X\leq -0.2574297760636474)=25.28160763586641</m>% where <m>X</m> is a normal variable with mean <m>-0.17</m> and standard error <m>0.131344135960773</m>.
         </li>
         <li>
             If there were actually a difference in average yield of  <m>-0.17</m> pounds,  a study where the number of observed plants was  <m>n=39</m> would only have a <m>25.28160763586641</m>% chance of detecting it.
         </li>
         <li>
             The <m>z</m>-score for a left-tail of <m>60</m>% is <m>0.2533471031357997</m>.  So for this <m>60</m>% tail to be detectable, <m>-0.17+0.2533471031357997SE\approx -1.96SE</m>, so <m>SE\approx 0.07680800089359018 </m>, and for this to be true <m>n\geq 115</m>
         </li>
         
          
      </ul>
