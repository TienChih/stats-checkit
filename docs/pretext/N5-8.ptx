          A kinesiologist wants to compare the average finishing speeds of the 100 meter dash using two training techniques.  She wants to be able to detect a difference of <m> -0.1</m>  seconds. Suppose she is aware the finishing times of both methods have standard deviation  <m> 0.78</m>  seconds.
      </p>
      
      <ol>
          <li>
              What is the power of a test if the number of 100 meter dashes she observed of each training method was  <m>n=47</m>?
          </li>
          <li>
              Explain what this power means in the context of this problem.
          </li>
          <li>
              How many 100 meter dashes of each training method would she have to observe to detect this difference with power:  <m>80</m>%?
          </li>
      </ol>

      <title>Partial Solution:</title>
      
     <ul>
          <li>
              The standard error if <m>n=47</m> would be <m>SE=0.160901714416372</m>.  The cutoff for a statistically significant test is a difference of <m>-0.31536156530683784</m>  seconds.  The power of the test is <m>P(X\leq -0.31536156530683784)=9.03721959379613</m>% where <m>X</m> is a normal variable with mean <m>-0.1</m> and standard error <m>0.160901714416372</m>.
         </li>
         <li>
             If there were actually a difference in finishing times of  <m>-0.1</m> seconds,  a study where the number of observations was  <m>n=47</m> would only have a <m>9.03721959379613</m>% chance of detecting it.
         </li>
         <li>
             The <m>z</m>-score for a left-tail of <m>80</m>% is <m>0.8416212335729144</m>.  So for this <m>80</m>% tail to be detectable, <m>-0.1+0.8416212335729144SE\approx -1.96SE</m>, so <m>SE\approx 0.035694077536344175 </m>, and for this to be true <m>n\geq 956</m>
         </li>
         
          
      </ul>
