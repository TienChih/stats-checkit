          The average salary of employees in Division A was  <m>\bar{x}_1=54.14</m>  thousand dollars, with sample standard deviation <m>s_1=4.673</m> thousand dollars, and sample size <m>n_1=33</m> employees.

          The average salary of employees in Division B was  <m>\bar{x}_2=51.834</m>  thousand dollars, with sample standard deviation <m>s_2=4.62</m> thousand dollars, and sample size <m>n_2=46</m> employees.

          The average salary of employees in Division C was  <m>\bar{x}_3=51.697</m>  thousand dollars, with sample standard deviation <m>s_3=3.48</m> thousand dollars, and sample size <m>n_3=50</m> employees.

              The standard error if <m>n=129</m> would be <m>SE=</m>.  The cutoff for a statistically significant test is a difference of <m></m>  thousand dollars.  The power of the test is <m>P(X\leq )=\%</m> where <m>X</m> is a normal variable with mean <m></m> and standard error <m></m>.

         <li>
             The <m>z</m>-score for a left-tail of <m>\%</m> is <m></m>.  So for this <m>\%</m> tail to be detectable, <m>+SE\approx -1.96SE</m>, so <m>SE\approx  </m>, and for this to be true <m>n\geq 46</m>
