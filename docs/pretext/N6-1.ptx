      <p>A materials engineer tests the average electrical conductivity of three different experimental alloys so she can see if there was any difference.</p>
      
      <p>
          The average electrical conductivity for alloy samples of Alloy A was  <m>\bar{x}_1=72.725</m>  million Siemens/meter, with sample standard deviation <m>s_1=10.995</m> million Siemens/meter, and sample size <m>n_1=40</m> alloy samples.
      </p>
      
      <p>
          The average electrical conductivity for alloy samples of Alloy B was  <m>\bar{x}_2=71.188</m>  million Siemens/meter, with sample standard deviation <m>s_2=8.6</m> million Siemens/meter, and sample size <m>n_2=49</m> alloy samples.

      <p>
          The average electrical conductivity for alloy samples of Alloy C was  <m>\bar{x}_3=77.323</m>  million Siemens/meter, with sample standard deviation <m>s_3=10.434</m> million Siemens/meter, and sample size <m>n_3=34</m> alloy samples.

      <p>
          The average electrical conductivity of all <m>n=123</m> sample alloys was <m>\bar{x}=73.3837</m>  million Siemens/meter.
