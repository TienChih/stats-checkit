  <statement>
      <p>A financial analyst examine the growth rate of different investments from three different investment portfolios over the last year, so they can see if there was any average difference.</p>
      
      <p>
          The average rate of return for investments in Portfolio A was  <m>\bar{x}_1=6.296</m>  %, with sample standard deviation <m>s_1=7.269</m> %, and sample size <m>n_1=44</m> analyzed investment.
      </p>
      
      <p>
          The average rate of return for investments in Portfolio B was  <m>\bar{x}_2=4.898</m>  %, with sample standard deviation <m>s_2=4.683</m> %, and sample size <m>n_2=33</m> analyzed investment.
      </p>
      
      <p>
          The average rate of return for investments in Portfolio C was  <m>\bar{x}_3=10.663</m>  %, with sample standard deviation <m>s_3=12.535</m> %, and sample size <m>n_3=35</m> analyzed investment.
      </p>
      
      <p>
          The average rate of return for of all <m>n=112</m> analyzed investments was <m>\bar{x}=7.2488</m>  %.
