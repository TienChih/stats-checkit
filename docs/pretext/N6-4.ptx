  <statement>
      <p>A financial analyst examine the growth rate of different investments from three different investment portfolios over the last year, so they can see if there was any average difference.</p>
      
      <p>
          The average rate of return for investments in Portfolio A was  <m>\bar{x}_1=13.567</m>  %, with sample standard deviation <m>s_1=4.377</m> %, and sample size <m>n_1=49</m> analyzed investment.
      </p>
      
      <p>
          The average rate of return for investments in Portfolio B was  <m>\bar{x}_2=12.343</m>  %, with sample standard deviation <m>s_2=4.425</m> %, and sample size <m>n_2=39</m> analyzed investment.
      </p>
      
      <p>
          The average rate of return for investments in Portfolio C was  <m>\bar{x}_3=11.202</m>  %, with sample standard deviation <m>s_3=4.148</m> %, and sample size <m>n_3=39</m> analyzed investment.
      </p>
      
      <p>
          The average rate of return for of all <m>n=127</m> analyzed investments was <m>\bar{x}=12.4649</m>  %.
