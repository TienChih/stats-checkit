  <statement>
      <p>A psychologist divides test subjects into different groups where they under a different digital interactive experience. Afterwards, she measures their resting heart rates to see if there was any difference.</p>
      
      <p>
          The average resting heart rate for test subjects in Group A was  <m>\bar{x}_1=72.438</m>  bpm, with sample standard deviation <m>s_1=8.544</m> bpm, and sample size <m>n_1=30</m> test subjects.
      </p>
      
      <p>
          The average resting heart rate for test subjects in Group B was  <m>\bar{x}_2=76.928</m>  bpm, with sample standard deviation <m>s_2=8.121</m> bpm, and sample size <m>n_2=47</m> test subjects.
      </p>
      
      <p>
          The average resting heart rate for test subjects in Group C was  <m>\bar{x}_3=76.499</m>  bpm, with sample standard deviation <m>s_3=10.75</m> bpm, and sample size <m>n_3=36</m> test subjects.

      <p>
          The average resting heart rate of all <m>n=113</m> test subjects was <m>\bar{x}=75.5993</m>  bpm.
