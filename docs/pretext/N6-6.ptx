      <p>A materials engineer tests the average electrical conductivity of three different experimental alloys so she can see if there was any difference.</p>
      
      <p>
          The average electrical conductivity for alloy samples of Alloy A was  <m>\bar{x}_1=71.099</m>  million Siemens/meter, with sample standard deviation <m>s_1=9.401</m> million Siemens/meter, and sample size <m>n_1=43</m> alloy samples.
      </p>
      
      <p>
          The average electrical conductivity for alloy samples of Alloy B was  <m>\bar{x}_2=71.436</m>  million Siemens/meter, with sample standard deviation <m>s_2=8.646</m> million Siemens/meter, and sample size <m>n_2=41</m> alloy samples.
      </p>
      
      <p>
          The average electrical conductivity for alloy samples of Alloy C was  <m>\bar{x}_3=75.678</m>  million Siemens/meter, with sample standard deviation <m>s_3=11.46</m> million Siemens/meter, and sample size <m>n_3=39</m> alloy samples.

      <p>
          The average electrical conductivity of all <m>n=123</m> sample alloys was <m>\bar{x}=72.6632</m>  million Siemens/meter.
