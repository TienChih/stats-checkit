  <statement>
      <p>A financial analyst examine the growth rate of different investments from three different investment portfolios over the last year, so they can see if there was any average difference.</p>
      
      <p>
          The average rate of return for investments in Portfolio A was  <m>\bar{x}_1=12.392</m>  %, with sample standard deviation <m>s_1=4.591</m> %, and sample size <m>n_1=46</m> analyzed investment.
      </p>
      
      <p>
          The average rate of return for investments in Portfolio B was  <m>\bar{x}_2=11.161</m>  %, with sample standard deviation <m>s_2=5.238</m> %, and sample size <m>n_2=40</m> analyzed investment.
      </p>
      
      <p>
          The average rate of return for investments in Portfolio C was  <m>\bar{x}_3=10.253</m>  %, with sample standard deviation <m>s_3=4.589</m> %, and sample size <m>n_3=49</m> analyzed investment.
      </p>
      
      <p>
          The average rate of return for of all <m>n=135</m> analyzed investments was <m>\bar{x}=11.2509</m>  %.
