  <statement>
      <p>A psychologist divides test subjects into different groups where they under a different digital interactive experience. Afterwards, she measures their resting heart rates to see if there was any difference.</p>
      
      <p>
          The average resting heart rate for test subjects in Group A was  <m>\bar{x}_1=87.744</m>  bpm, with sample standard deviation <m>s_1=11.552</m> bpm, and sample size <m>n_1=48</m> test subjects.
      </p>
      
      <p>
          The average resting heart rate for test subjects in Group B was  <m>\bar{x}_2=86.132</m>  bpm, with sample standard deviation <m>s_2=12.696</m> bpm, and sample size <m>n_2=42</m> test subjects.
      </p>
      
      <p>
          The average resting heart rate for test subjects in Group C was  <m>\bar{x}_3=93.432</m>  bpm, with sample standard deviation <m>s_3=11.853</m> bpm, and sample size <m>n_3=35</m> test subjects.
