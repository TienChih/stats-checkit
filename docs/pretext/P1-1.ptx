  <statement>
      
      <p>
          We consider the event that a restaurant in a large city accepts Visa credit cards, and the event that they accept Mastercard.  We consider a randomly selected restaurant.
      </p>
      
      <p>
          Suppose that   the probability that    the restaurant accepts Mastercard is <m>0.6631</m>, the probability that   the restaurant accepts Visa is <m>0.7025</m>, and finally   the probability that   the restaurant accepts both Visa and Mastercard is <m>0.5596</m>.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>
          <ol>
              <li>
                  <p>
                      Find the probability that    the restaurant accepts at least one of Visa or  Mastercard (but possibly not both).
                  </p>

                      (For the following, it is advisable to draw a venn diagram using the information above.)

              <li>
                  Find the probability that  the  restaurant does not accept Visa but does accept Mastercard.
              </li>
              <li>
                  Find the probability that  the  restaurant  accepts Visa or it does not accept Mastercard.
