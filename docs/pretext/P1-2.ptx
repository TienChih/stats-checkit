  <statement>
      
      <p>
          An employee has requested both a raise and a promotion.  We consider the event that they recieve a raise, and the event they recieve a promotion.
      </p>
      
      <p>
          Suppose that   the probability that   the employee gets a raise is <m>0.5652</m>, the probability that    the employee gets either a raise or a promotion is <m>0.7902</m>, and finally   the probability that   the employee gets a raise and a promotion is <m>0.4311</m>.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>
          <ol>
              <li>
                  <p>
                      Find the probability that    the employee gets a promotion.
                  </p>

              <li>
                  Find the probability that  the employee does not get a raise but they do get a promotion.
              </li>
              <li>
                  Find the probability that  the employee gets a raise or they do not get a promotion.
