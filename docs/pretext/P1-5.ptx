      <p>
          We consider the event that there is an accident over the course of the day, and the event that it rains.
      </p>
      
      <p>
          Suppose that   the probability that    it rains, or there is an accident, over the course of a day is <m>0.113</m>, the probability that   there is an accident on a road over the course of a day is <m>0.0238</m>, and finally   the probability that   there is an accident on a road and it rains over the course of a day is <m>0.0119</m>.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>
          <ol>
              <li>
                  <p>
                      Find the probability that    it rains over the course of a day.

              <li>
                  Find the probability that  there is no accident on the road but it rains over the course of a day.
              </li>
              <li>
                  Find the probability that  there is an accident on the road or it doesn't rain over the course of a day.
