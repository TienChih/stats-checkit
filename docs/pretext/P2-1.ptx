      <p>
          A delivery service operates in a city where it snows in the winter. Suppose it is now winter.  We consider the events that on a randomly selected day that they are late making deliveries, and the event that it snows that day.
      </p>
      
      <p>
          Suppose that   the probability that   the service is late on this day is <m>0.11</m>, the probability that   the service is late given that it snows on this day is <m>0.75</m>, and finally   the probability that    it snows on this day is <m>0.08</m>.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>
          <ol>
              <li>
                  Find the probability that    the service is late and it snows on this day.
              </li>
              <li>
                  Find the probability that    it snows, given that the service is late on this day.
              </li>
              <li>
                  Are the events   the service is late on this day, and    it snows on this day independent?
              </li>
          </ol>
