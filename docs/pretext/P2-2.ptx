  <statement>
      
      <p>
          We randomly select a customer from a store and consider the events that they purchase over $100, and the event they use a credit card.
      </p>
      
      <p>
          Suppose that   the probability that   the customer purchases over $100 is <m>0.059</m>, the probability that   the customer purchases over $100 given that they use a credit card is <m>0.059</m>, and finally   the probability that    the customer uses a credit card is <m>0.725</m>.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>
          <ol>
              <li>
                  Find the probability that    the customer purchases over $100 and uses a credit card.
              </li>
              <li>
                  Find the probability that    the customer uses a credit card, given that they purchased over $100.
              </li>
              <li>
                  Are the events   the customer purchases over $100, and    the customer uses a credit card independent?
              </li>
          </ol>
          
      </p>
