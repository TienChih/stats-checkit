      <p>
          A company advertises a spray that is meant to prevent insect infestations of crops.  We consider the events that a farmer has an insect i festation of their crops, and the event that they use the spray.
      </p>
      
      <p>
          Suppose that   the probability that   the farmer's crops have an infestation is <m>0.28</m>, the probability that   the farmer has an infestation of their crops given that they use the spray is <m>0.28</m>, and finally   the probability that    the farmer uses the spray is <m>0.46</m>.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>
          <ol>
              <li>
                  Find the probability that    the farmer has an infestation of their crops and they use the spray.
              </li>
              <li>
                  Find the probability that    the farmer uses the spray, given that they had an infestation of their crops.
              </li>
              <li>
                  Are the events   the farmer's crops have an infestation, and    the farmer uses the spray independent?
              </li>
          </ol>

                  The events   the farmer's crops have an infestation, and    the farmer uses the spray  are independent.
