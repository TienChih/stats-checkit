      <p>
          An interview coach promises employees of a company that going through their course will help applicants get a promotion.  We consider the events that an applicant is promoted and the event that they go through the course.
      </p>
      
      <p>
          Suppose that   the probability that   the applicant gets a promotion is <m>0.34</m>, the probability that   the applicant gets a promotion given that they wen't through the course is <m>0.34</m>, and finally   the probability that    the applicant goes through the course is <m>0.17</m>.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>
          <ol>
              <li>
                  Find the probability that    the applicant both got a promotion and went through the course.
              </li>
              <li>
                  Find the probability that    the customer went through the course, given that they got a promotion.
              </li>
              <li>
                  Are the events   the applicant gets a promotion, and    the applicant goes through the course independent?
              </li>
          </ol>
          
      </p>

              <li>
                  The events   the applicant gets a promotion, and    the applicant goes through the course  are independent.
