  <statement>
      
      <p>
          Consider a town where sometimes it is cloudy, and sometimes it is raining.  We consider the events that it rains by the evening, and the event it is cloudy in the morning.
      </p>
      
      <p>
          Suppose that   the probability that   it rains by evening, given that it was cloudy in the morning is <m>0.7</m>, the probability that   it rains by evening, given that it was not cloudy in the morning is <m>0.05</m>.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>
          <ol>
              <li>
                  Suppose it were the case that the probability    it is cloudy in the morning was <m>0.57</m>.
                  <ol>
                      <li>
                          Find the probability that   it rains by evening.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                          Find the probability that    it was cloudy in the morning, given that it rains by the evening.

              </li>
              <li>
                  Suppose instead that it was the case where the probability   it rains by evening was <m>0.3</m>.  Find the probability that    it is cloudy in the morning.
