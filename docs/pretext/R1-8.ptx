      <p>
          A professor observes how many cups of coffee they drink in a day, compared to how many hours of sleep they get that night.
      </p>
      
      <p>
          Consider this table of data collected comparing Coffee Consumption measured in cups, and Sleep measured in hours:
          <me>
               \begin{array}{|c|c|}
